# Voicemeeter Potato Bypass

thank you chat GPT. lol

This code is compiled with Zig, it probably can be compiled with gcc but didnt test it

Probably the voicemeeter devs will someday change this so idk how much time will it work, as the name says, its not a crack, its a bypass

this code have some definable preprocesor variables so you can customise what it does or what it doesnt

The program will wait 2 minutes to voicemeeter to start

in summary, it can (depending on what you enable):
  * change the time left variable to 0
  * change the function that changes the time left so that it always turns it to 0
  * log to console what is doing or what it did
  * log into a .txt file
  * close the registration window
  * close the main window
  * close the drivers error window(in my case it appears, so i like this activated)
